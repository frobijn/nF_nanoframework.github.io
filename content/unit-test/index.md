# .NET **nanoFramework** Unit Tests platform

nanoFramework offers a complete Unit Tests platform called `nanoFramework.TestFramework`

nanoFramework.TestFramework is a Unit Test platform dedicated to .NET **nanoFramework**! It has all the benefits of what you're used to when using Microsoft Test platform for .NET, NUnit, xUnit or any other!

The current version of the Test platform is v3. New test projects are created using that version. Older test projects can be upgraded to the new version, but it is also possible to keep using the previous version of the test platform. The documentation describes both:

- Documentation of the [TestFramework v3](framework-v3)
- Documentation of the [TestFramework v2](framework-v2)
- How-to guide for the [migration of v2 to v3](framework-v3/migrate-from-v2)
